Application Library for OptechX

### Icons

Icons need to be uploaded into the [Library.Apps.Images](https://github.com/OptechX/library.apps.images) github repo prior to be initial upload, or they will not be updated until the cron is run.

Path to upload images is:

```powershell
https://github.com/OptechX/library.apps.images/raw/main/$($env:applicationCategory)/$($yamlLocale.Publisher)/$($yamlLocale.PackageIdentifier)/icon.svg
```

    <releaseNotes>
    Tencent does not publish release notes for WeChat for Windows.

    Silent installs are out of the scope of Tencent's work. Beginning with wechat v3.9.5.81, silent installs will be impossible with the official installer. This is because the /S parameter is incorrectly handled by one of the
    installation binaries, hanging the installation. Additionally, AutoHotKey scripts can only use mouse click events because keyboard events are ignored by WeChat. Please contact the maintainers with any information that can help restore silent installs.

    The WeChat Installer may differ from location to location. If you experience problems installing this package, please try installing a different version. WeChat will then upgrade itself through its built-in updater. For the complete version history, visit https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/wechat/#versionhistory

    If you experience problems upgrading WeChat through Chocolatey, please pin the installed package to suppress upgrades:

    choco pin add -n wechat

    WeChat will continue to upgrade itself through its built-in updater regardless of the pin. For more information, visit https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/pin

    The WeChat installer has a version number that is different from that of WeChat itself. The Chocolatey package tries to conform to the WeChat version.
